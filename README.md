This is the website for my game, <i>Fantasia</i>.  It contains download links for the compiled version, and the ability to play in your browser.  Most of this website was generated with Wordpress, most especially 'style.css', a 6,000 line file of Cascading Style Sheets.  Other parts were written by me, using the CSS from Wordpress.

Change log is available on the <a href="https://github.com/fantasia-wizard/Fantasia">main repository</a>.
